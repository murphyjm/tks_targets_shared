TOIs with Priority 1 that get dropped when removing targets that fail spectroscopic vetting
(none)

TOIs with Priority 1 that get dropped when removing targets that fail spectroscopic vetting
(none)

TOIs with Priority 1 that get dropped when removing targets with ‘hires_prv’ = ‘no’
- 560.01
    - activity too high to warrant burning a bunch of time
- 1179.01
    - note: Active (R'hk = -4.703), out of transit variability that phases at orbital period, likely EB, AO revealed a faint companion 2.5" away

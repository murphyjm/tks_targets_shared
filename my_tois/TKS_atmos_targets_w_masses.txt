TARGETS THAT ARE IN SC3 AND HAVE SOME MASS MEASUREMENTS
-TOI 561.02	35 Keck obs (3 planet system). The P1 planet is
		1.5Re in a 0.4 day orbit (4600F_e) so possible
		it has no atmosphere. It's the only
		planet in this bin aside from Kepler-1323b. 
		561 also has two potentially desirable 
		sub-Neptunes (.01 and .03) that are cooler, 
		but only okay in their bin [3,3,3]. 

-TOI 554.01	33 Keck obs, 90 APF obs. Very bright (V~6.9)
aka		Best in its bin (3,4,3) aside from an 	
HD25463		unconfirmed K2 candidate. Might be a good
		companion to 1339.01 or 469.01 or 509.01
		as "fairly highly-irradiated mini-Neptunes
		around >5500K stars"). Much brighter and
		higher TSM than other planets in the bin. 
		This is a late F star it looks like, so
		probably a similar objection to Ian's 
		re: 509.01, but would be epic if 
		we could do it. 

-TOI 455.01	32 Keck obs. Probably outshone by L 98-59, 
aka		so even though it's a pretty interesting 
GJ3193		target we're not likely to want to do it.
		It is brighter in V (10.6 vs 11.7) and in
		J (7.3 vs 7.9), but not by enough to make
		a huge difference. Worse still, there's a
		much higher-TSM PC (1680.01) in the same
		bin that's also in the northern hemisphere
		(the only knock on L 98-59), although that
		one is much dimmer. :( 

-TOI 421.01	27 Keck obs. Apparently shaping up nicely.
		Technically P4, but exact same TSM as the
		next target above it (WASP-84) while being
		~0.8mag brighter in V and J. The top target
		has a much higher TSM but is also 9.1Re
		vs 6.4 for this one. K2-24 c is more similar
		at 7.5Re and has a higher TSM (164 vs 117).
		I think this would fit ok with a suite of 
		proposals for "Neptune +/- 2 Re" that 
		included most of the other planets on this
		list. 

-TOI 469.01	25 Keck obs. This is in a bin well-populated
aka		with TOIs (1339.01/.02, 509.01, and 561.01
HD42813		are all sharing this space, all of which
		we're getting masses on anyway). But, we've
		been looking at it anyway, so why throw it
		away, I guess? This one is notably different
		from its peers in that its Teff is 6100K, 
		compared to <5600K for everything else
		around. RadVel fit still needs some work; 
		possible outer companion? Noticeable slope
		on residuals. 

TOI 509.01	23 Keck obs, 61 APF obs. Ah, the notorious 
aka		"what the heck is going on with those RVs"
HD63935		system. Well, if we get it, it'll fit in 
		with "mini-ish-Neptunes around hot stars" 
		program that kinda seems to be shaping
		up here. Honestly, might be nice to get
		another photometric transit of the 22 day
		signal and see if that's real (although
		it would be pretty high effort to put that
		together). 

I think things in SC3 below this are probably too obs-poor
that we'll have anything by proposal deadline, but I know
some atmos priority planets are missing from the JUMP 
program so I'm just going through those that have a ton
of obs and checking their atmospheric potential. 

TOI 562.01	on JUMP, we got some masses. It's small 
aka		(1.2Re) and cool (only ~ 500K) with a 
GJ357		decent TSM. Surely somebody is already
		on this, but if not, I would be REALLY
		interested in doing some work with it.
		P1 in the 1,3,1 bin. 

TOI 431.01	BOTH P1. .02 is a USP of 1.4Re, possibly
& 431.02	no atmosphere. .01 is a 3.87 day orbit 
		around an early K star. It was QLP 
		so previously off our radar, but it's 
		similar in parameter space to 560.01
		which we were sad about losing AND
		it's brighter by about half a mag. We're
		getting a bunch of Keck obs on it and
		apparently the RVs are shaping up.

#these targets are really good compared to the MEDIAN TSM in
their bin, and with respect to Vmag. Basically, they keep 
popping up no matter how you slice the data

421.01 (pretty good, and we're abt ready to
	publish it anyway as I recall)
469.01 (although this is in the same group as 
	509 and 1339, so maybe we don't care)
509.01 (warm Neptune and weird possible companion)
560.01 (warm Neptune, cooler star)
561.01/.02 (has a great USP target plus a 
	10 day sub-Neptune (3.8Re) companion 
	which is worse than 509,469,1339.01,
	and HD3167, but it's the next one down)
	Although, would the USP have an atmos??
635.01 (if it has an atmosphere - USP, 1.5Re,
	0.5 day (!!) orbit)
656.01 (big, near-Jovian around 4400K star. Great
	target but dim in V. OH LMAO THIS IS 
	JUST WASP-43b)
*732.01 (low V ~ 13.1, but GREAT 1.1Re in 0.7d orbit,
	and really good 1.8Re in 12 day orbit. 
	.01 is MUCH brighter in V than 736.01 and 1276.01, 
	nominally the P2 and P3 in its bin. TOI270c
	is P1 and is too far south)
1283.01 (warm-ish Jupiter; 700K, 5300K star.
	V ~ 10. Extremely strong target relative
	to others in parameter space. WASP-107b is
	better but star is 4400K.)
1339.01 (also, has a pretty good companion, 
	1339.02, in the same bin - neat!)
1412.01 (big, warm saturn, low V ~ 12.3)


*732 is almost certainly too dim to get a good mass
	with HIRES.

1680.01 - "flare-like event", not included in TOI+ list
1681.01 - P3, 2.9Re, 1.5 day orbit, Teff ~5760K. Worse
	than 1598.01 (TSM is 86 vs 103, V 11 vs 9.1), 
	probably as good as P2 (K2-100b, with TSM 77
	and V 10.7)
1685.01 - P2, very sparsely populated bin (only 3 targets, 
	all unconfirmed TOIs). TSM < 20 for all so 
	probably drop. 
1694.01 - 2.0, hot super-Neptune

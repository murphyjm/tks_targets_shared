I'm not sure why. They are just as bad when using the Keck template so I don't think the template is the problem., In the Oct. 29 TKS meeting we theorized that the poor APF RV performance is due to the high Vsini and the relatively small chunk size in the APF Doppler analysis (because of smaller CCD pixels in APF compared to HIRES).  Howard is going to try running the Dop Code with larger chunks to see if performance improves., This is a potentially interesting (but challenging) RM target. It’s a ~3 Rearth planet in a 7 day orbit.  The star has high Vsini (11 km/s), but the transit depth is only 350 ppm, giving an expected Doppler amplitude of 4 m/s.  This should be observable for a V = 6.9 target and a transit duration of 3.3 hours.  There don’t appear to be any well-timed transits for HIRES in the coming year.  Maybe if we can get the APF RVs working for this high Vsini star, that’s an option.   We could also think about other facilities., I dusted off the old iGrand doppler code and ran the APF data through it. This code fits full orders at a time so high vsini is less problematic. I made a custom RadVel fit that uses these iGrand APF velocities., Radius Planet = 2.8 R⊕

Dear Lauren,

I have cc-ed here the major HARPS-N people involved with TOI-561 (Giampaolo and Luca) and our HARPS-N President (Stéphane).

We (well, Luca) ran some analyses on our current data and just discussed all of it in our team meeting.

We now have 26 RVs spanning ~ 2months with an average precision of ~1m/s.

We fail to find significant results on masses for all three of the planets. This was a tad surprising to us given that you found 2/3 sigma detections with the same amount of data.

Since this is an intriguing target for multiple science reasons, we would like to require more data in our upcoming runs before deciding what to do and how to proceed. Our next run is the first week of February.

Are you still observing this and would you mind sharing your plans?

Title: The TESS Keck Survey I: Masses, Densities, and Orbits of Three Sub-Neptune Sized Transiting Planets in TOI-561
Authors: Lauren M. Weiss, Fei Dai, the TESS Keck Survey, and others

Abstract: Systems with multiple transiting planets provide excellent natural laboratories for testing the physics of planet formation, since the planets all formed around the same star and from the same protoplanetary disk.  Furthermore, the formation of ultra-short period planets (USPs), which are primarily rocky planets with orbital periods $<1 $ day, is poorly understood.  The NASA \TESS\ Mission has discovered TOI-561, a multi-planet system containing a USP.  This bright ($V=10.2$) star hosts three small transiting planet candidates: TOI-561 b (P=0.4 days, \rpl=1.6\,\rearth), c (P=10.8 days, \rpl= 3.2\,\rearth), and d (P=16.4 days, \rpl=2.8\,\rearth).  With radial velocities obtained on Keck/HIRES and [other facilities welcome], we confirm the planetary nature of all three candidates.  Planet b has \mpl= and \rhopl = , which are consistent with a rocky composition.  Planet c has \mpl= and \rhopl=, and planet d has \mpl= and \rhopl=), both of which are consistent with an interior rocky core overlaid with a low-mass volatile envelope.  The masses, radii, and orbits of the TOI-561 planets can be used to constrain the history of the system, and in particular to elucidate how the USP arrived at its present orbit.

Hi Lauren,

My preliminary modeling shows that our best estimates for Teff and L (from Gaia) are hard to reconcile with the measured [Fe/H] from Specmatch. I then noticed that TOI-561 has high Gaia proper motion:

PM_RA: -108.432 0.088
PM_DE: -61.511 0.094

Combining this with the Gaia RV makes the star kinematically consistent with the thick disc (see https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.07825). To confirm this, it'd be great to measure alpha-element abundances from the HIRES spectra. I can look into this, but it'd probably quicker and more reliable to ask John Brewer to run SME. If the star is indeed alpha-enhanced this would remove the discrepancy since it would enhance the bulk metallicity [M/H] (used by the interior models); it would be also be a nice spin on this system since there aren't many known multis around old, thick disc stars.

Hi Lauren,

My preliminary modeling shows that our best estimates for Teff and L (from Gaia) are hard to reconcile with the measured [Fe/H] from Specmatch. I then noticed that TOI-561 has high Gaia proper motion:

PM_RA: -108.432 0.088
PM_DE: -61.511 0.094

Combining this with the Gaia RV makes the star kinematically consistent with the thick disc (see https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.07825).

Hi Lauren,

I checked in on the job and it is already done, however, I don't have time today or tomorrow to look at it.  I can give you some rough numbers and a sense of how things came out and I will give you plots & real numbers at the end of the week.  I haven't applied my empirical corrections to the values quoted below, so they will change a wee bit, but are close.

Teff ~ 5300 K ± 25
logg ~ 4.47 ± 0.05
[Fe/H] ~ -0.45, alphas closer to -0.25, so it is alpha enhanced.  Oxygen is coming back anomalously high though (+0.1) so I want to take a look at the fit etc. first.

We fail to find significant results on masses for all three of the planets. This was a tad surprising to us given that you found 2/3 sigma detections with the same amount of data.

Since this is an intriguing target for multiple science reasons, we would like to require more data in our upcoming runs before deciding what to do and how to proceed. Our next run is the first week of February.

Are you still observing this and would you mind sharing your plans?

Title: The TESS Keck Survey I: Masses, Densities, and Orbits of Three Sub-Neptune Sized Transiting Planets in TOI-561
Authors: Lauren M. Weiss, Fei Dai, the TESS Keck Survey, and others

Abstract: Systems with multiple transiting planets provide excellent natural laboratories for testing the physics of planet formation, since the planets all formed around the same star and from the same protoplanetary disk.  Furthermore, the formation of ultra-short period planets (USPs), which are primarily rocky planets with orbital periods $<1 $ day, is poorly understood.  The NASA \TESS\ Mission has discovered TOI-561, a multi-planet system containing a USP.  This bright ($V=10.2$) star hosts three small transiting planet candidates: TOI-561 b (P=0.4 days, \rpl=1.6\,\rearth), c (P=10.8 days, \rpl= 3.2\,\rearth), and d (P=16.4 days, \rpl=2.8\,\rearth).  With radial velocities obtained on Keck/HIRES and [other facilities welcome], we confirm the planetary nature of all three candidates.  Planet b has \mpl= and \rhopl = , which are consistent with a rocky composition.  Planet c has \mpl= and \rhopl=, and planet d has \mpl= and \rhopl=), both of which are consistent with an interior rocky core overlaid with a low-mass volatile envelope.  The masses, radii, and orbits of the TOI-561 planets can be used to constrain the history of the system, and in particular to elucidate how the USP arrived at its present orbit.

Hi Lauren,

My preliminary modeling shows that our best estimates for Teff and L (from Gaia) are hard to reconcile with the measured [Fe/H] from Specmatch. I then noticed that TOI-561 has high Gaia proper motion:

PM_RA: -108.432 0.088
PM_DE: -61.511 0.094

Combining this with the Gaia RV makes the star kinematically consistent with the thick disc (see https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.07825). To confirm this, it'd be great to measure alpha-element abundances from the HIRES spectra. I can look into this, but it'd probably quicker and more reliable to ask John Brewer to run SME. If the star is indeed alpha-enhanced this would remove the discrepancy since it would enhance the bulk metallicity [M/H] (used by the interior models); it would be also be a nice spin on this system since there aren't many known multis around old, thick disc stars.

I've attached a plot for reference (iteration 10 is what you should look at). I suspect that this is because the S/N is much lower for these observations compared to 25463. This might improve with a lot more (~100) observations, but I'm not sure that's worth it.

The next thing to try would be to change our primary doppler code to use larger chunk widths. I'm not sure how much work that would entail, but I think its significant., Message from Sam Quinn on this system:

Hope you're doing well. We noticed that there are 33 APF observations of TOI 1135 reported on the SG2/SG4 sheet. Are these your data (or your collaborators)?

You've probably noticed that it's a relatively young star. Based on Li EW and rotation, it appears to be roughly around Praesepe/Hyades age. We're interested in the system as well, but given that you're pretty far along toward a mass measurement (hope that's panning out!), we were considering Doppler tomography observations to measure the obliquity rather than going after an orbit. If you have already scheduled or obtained spectroscopy during transit yourself, that could influence our plans to do the same. In the interest of not wasting/duplicating effort, would you be willing to share your plans for this system?",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,

New paper by Hara et. al ""The SOPHIE search for northern extrasolar planets. XVII. A compact planetary system in a near 3:2 mean motion resonance chain"" 
They are claiming 4 planets and a possible fifth., Recent TOI release has revealed a new transiting inner planet. One of the special aspects of this system is the chain of 3:2 mean motion resonances. The orbital period of the new (1.3 Earth radius) inner planet is 2.18 days, which further adds to the chain since it's in 3:2 resonance with the inner 3.4 day period RV planet. So the chain is even longer than expected! This is part of our APT program monitoring TESS known exoplanet hosts and so I have request with Dave Latham that we lead the discovery paper, for which we can also include the HIRES data. I sent Dave the request on Dec 5th and still awaiting response., This is an ATL (asteroseismic target list) target with a fairly decent detection probability and because it has already known planets, would make the asteroseismic detection more valuable. I've had a look at the single sector and see some power excess where we expect (~2000 muHz), but it's too soon to tell. If there is any interest within the group on this system, let's chat. I think we expect a few more sectors for this target so we may be able to get some asteroseismic constraints!, Web TESS viewing tool suggests 6 total sectors of data, doubling the asteroseismic detection probability (>0.5). This is now a high priority target for Ashley's Thesis",1,8,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,,,18.0

The lines are indeed narrow as one can see by looking at the spectrum., 1468.01 (15 day planet) is a decent atmospheric target (TSM ~88) in a relatively underpopulated bin in radius-insolation flux-Teff space. K2-18 b is also in the same bin and already has an HST/WFC3 spectrum with a water vapor feature: https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.04642, 1468.01 (15 day planet) is a decent atmospheric target (TSM ~88) in a relatively underpopulated bin in radius-insolation flux-Teff space.

We present the discovery and characterization of a transiting sub-Neptune-sized planet around TOI-1611 (also known as HD207897 or TIC 264678534), based on photometry and radial velocity measurements obtained by the short cadence of Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and SOPHIE high precision spectrograph. The host star is a bright (V=8.37) K0 dwarf which was continuously observed by TESS during sectors 18 and 19 while it was initially monitored in the context of the SOPHIE exoplanet consortium’s dedicate to explore of low-mass planets which obtained 44 high-resolution spectra over 3 years. By using the transit least squares (TLS) algorithm and considering the stellar host characteristics, we find that TOI-1611b is a mini- Neptune planet with radii of 2.2 R_Earth and orbits around its host star at a period of 16.2 days. We analyze the RV SOPHIE measurements, establish the planetary nature of this TESS candidate, and measure a planetary mass of 19.7 M_Earth. A simultaneous joint model of photometry and RVs data using two different packages, PASTIS and EXOFAST V2 in order to increase the precision of the planetary parameter is done., Abstract of Heidari et al.

(2011) found transits of HD 97658 b using ground-based photometry from the Automated Photometric Telescope (APT)!!  Five partial transits were observed and all showed egress at 2-3.5 sigma significance.  Four other epoch were observed under similar conditions, when transits were not predicted, and transits were not detected!   Combining the five nights with predicted transits gave a 5.5-sigma detection with a transit depth of 1470 ± 260 ppm.  The four nights without transits were consistent with flat and gave a transit depth of 400 ± 398 ppm. https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011arXiv1109.2549H/abstract
However, this discovery was later shown to be wrong by follow-up observations by MOST and Spitzer. 
Note that the submission to ApJ of Henry et al. (2012) was withdrawn and the paper now only lives on arXiv., After the non-detection of transits of HD 97658b by MOST and Spitzer, the search continued.  Remarkably, both space telescopes discovered transits, but at a slightly different ephemeris (that is inconsistent with the transits from Henry et al. (2011)).

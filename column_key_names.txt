rp_key	 :	planet radius (from Toi+ list or Exoplanet Archive)
ms_key 	 :	stellar mass (from logg in Toi+ or E.A.)
pp_key	 :	planet period (from Toi+ list or E.A.)
Ts_key 	 :	stellar effective temperature (  "   )
ars_key	 :	orbital distance (a) over stellar radius. 
			calculated from period, star radius, 
			and star mass. Convenient quantity
			to have for calculating TSM / Teq
Jmag_key :	J magnitude. From E.A. or TIC candidate 
			starlist (https://exofop.ipac.caltech.edu/tess/search.php)
Vmag_key :	V magnitude. same source as J.
rs_key	 :	stellar radius. 
dec_key	 : 	declination
Fp_key	 :	insolation flux relative to Earth. from TOI+
			or calculated for known planets
mp_key	 :	planet mass. from E.A. or calculated based on
			basic M-R relationship (Louie et. al. 2018
			based on Chen & Kipping 2017) for TOIs
mp_units :	all masses in Earth units; built this in so the 
			code will be more versatile in the future, 
			although note that most functions do not 
			have any unit-functionality 
id_key	 :	the name of the planet. For TOIs, this is a float 
			corresponding to their TOI number (e.g. 1143.01)
			for known planets, this is a string. The planet
			letter is always given with a space after the
			name (i.e., HD 209458 b), which is not a
			universal convention but is the one used by
			Exoplanet Archive.
